# Used Car Price Prediction & Analysis Dashboard

🔹 Main Project Description

In order to forecast car prices based on important characteristics like brand, ownership, fuel type, transmission, engine capacity, kilometers driven, and manufacturing year, this project analyzes data from the used car market.

In order to provide insightful dashboards and an understanding of price prediction, the project integrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning concepts. Used car pricing trends, patterns, and relationships are investigated using a Tableau interactive dashboard.

The dashboard enables users to dynamically filter data and comprehend how various factors affect used car prices.

🔹 Objectives
1. Analyze factors influencing used car prices
2. Identify price trends across brands, fuel types, and ownership levels
3. Compare manual vs automatic transmission pricing
4. Visualize price vs year and brand vs kilometers driven
5. Provide an intuitive dashboard for business decision-making

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

1. Tableau Public – Data visualization & dashboard creation
2. Python – Data cleaning & preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
3. CSV – Dataset storage
4. GitHub – Project version control and documentation

🔹 Important Dashboard Information

1. Compared to automatic cars, manual cars have a higher count.
2. The pricing of used cars is dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles.
3. The average cost of first-owner cars is much higher.
4. In general, the cost of cars rises with more recent manufacturing years.
5. Certain brands demonstrate brand dependability by displaying more kilometers driven while maintaining their value.
